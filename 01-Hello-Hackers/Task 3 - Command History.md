# Task 3 - Command History

The 'hacker' has to utilize the command history feature of the linux terminal to scroll through the saved commands using the up and down arrows in order to find the flag already stored in the command history.

## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{YIoOzynP6ISUVQsNhLOIYp-77Y9.0lNzEzNxwyM2AzNzEzW}`

I pressed the up arrow which inserted the previous command (the flag in this case) into the command line.

## What I learned

- Learned how to navigate command logs in order to find previously used commands using the command history feature. This saves time and effort.
