# Hello Hackers - Intro to Commands

The 'hacker' has to invoke the "hello" command to get the flag.

## My solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{g8E-dOQjjVzsvrvM0oApMOJhPqR.QX3YjM1wyM2AzNzEzW}`

To solve the challenge, I just typed the command:

```bash
hello
```

After pressing enter, the program printed out the flag.

## What I learned

- Learned how to execute simple commands in the terminal
